## RFM Analysis: Understanding Customer Segmentation 🕐📟💲
RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis is a method used for customer segmentation and crafting marketing strategies. RFM stands for the initials of its three core components. This analysis aims to categorize customers based on specific criteria and divide them into different segments.

✔️Key Concepts of RFM Analysis:

🔸Recency (R):

Represents the time that has passed since a customer's last purchase.Customers with more recent purchases are generally considered more valuable, as they are likely to engage in repeated transactions.

🔸Frequency (F):

Indicates how often a customer makes purchases within a specific time frame.Customers who shop frequently are often considered more loyal and valuable.

🔸Monetary (M):

Refers to the total amount of money a customer has spent.Customers who have made significant purchases are often more financially impactful and potentially more
responsive to special offers.

✔️RFM Segmentation Categories:

🔸Champions:

Customers with high recency, frequency, and monetary values.

🔸Valued Customers:

Customers with highmonetary value but potentially lower recency and frequency.

🔸Recoverable Customers:

Customers with low recency, moderate frequency, and monetary values.This segment includes customers who can be re-engaged.

🔸At Risk Customers:

Customers with low recency, low frequency, and monetary values.These customers are at risk of attrition.

🔸Lost Customers:

Customers with the lowest recency, frequency, and monetary values.This segment generally includes customers who are harder to re-engage.

RFM analysis is used to personalize marketing strategies, enhance customer loyalty, and create targeted campaigns for specific segments. It provides insights into customer behaviors and enhances the effectiveness of marketing efforts.
